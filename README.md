Pull requests welcome. At the moment, we mostly need PID control. If you know how to help us there, please do!

Currently, to use the latest version of this AI, you will need to run first "create_training_data.py," then balance this data with "balance_Data.py."

Do this for as many files/training samples as you wish. I suggest 100K+ after balancing, but the more the merrier.

Next, Train the model with train_model.py.

Finally, use it with tesT_model.py.
